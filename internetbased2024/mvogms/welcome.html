For those returning, welcome back; for those joining us for the first time, I extend an extra warm greeting. Hogwarts is not just a school; it is a home, a place where magic thrives and friendships are forged.

    First and foremost, let me address the heart of our school: our four esteemed houses - Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house possesses its own unique qualities and values, and I encourage you to embrace and honor the traditions of your house while fostering unity among all.
    
    Now, to our enchanted castle itself. Hogwarts is full of secrets and wonders waiting to be discovered. From the moving staircases to the hidden passages, there is always something new to explore. However, let me offer a word of caution: while curiosity is encouraged, there are certain areas of the castle that remain off-limits for your safety.
    
    The Forbidden Forest, a vast expanse teeming with magical creatures, is strictly forbidden to students. Venturing into its depths can be perilous, and I urge you to heed this warning.
    
    Likewise, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is to be avoided at all costs. Trust me when I say that the dangers lurking within are best left undisturbed.
    
    But fear not, my dear students, for Hogwarts is not just a place of rules and restrictions. It is a place of learning, of growth, and of endless possibilities. Let your time here be marked by curiosity, kindness, and a thirst for knowledge.
    
    In the coming days, you will embark on a journey of magical discovery unlike any other. Embrace every moment, cherish every friendship, and remember that the magic of Hogwarts resides not just in its walls, but in each and every one of you.
    
    Welcome to Hogwarts, my dear students. Let the magic begin!"

    -Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore
